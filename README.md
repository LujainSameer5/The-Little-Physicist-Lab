# The-Little-Physicist-Lab
The Little physicist lab is an app for kids and young teens to teach them physics in a fun way.in order for a user to reach the content of the app, they will have to have an account, they can create an account if they don't have one or sign in if they already have an account.
once they're signed in, the app will allow the user
to explore the world of physics level by level, in each level, there are 4 steps:
1- learn 2-exam 3- explain 4-experiment.
first, the user can learn about the law or the experiment and the scientist who
has invented it, then the user will take a quick quiz of 4 questions about what
they had just learned, then the user can watch a video that will explain to them
how the experiment is done and lastly the user can experience the experiment.


The target group: Children and young teens from eight to fourteen years
old.



Project aims:
• Promote the concept and simplicity of physics for children and young
teens.
• Combined physics with technology to create a simulation of physical
experiment
• Applying all the concepts we learned in this course and other new concepts
that serve our needs to implement the idea.

Project Functionalities:
• The application must allow the user to create an account
• The application must allow users to log in to their accounts by entering
their email and password.
• The application must allow users to reset their password by clicking on "I
forgot my password" and receiving a validation code to their verified
email address.
• The application should teach its users some of the most famous laws of
physics.
• The application allows users to experience the lab experiment themselves
as a virtual simulate.
• The application gives information about the law applicable to the
experiment, as an example: information about the scientist who did the
experiment, information about the experiment.
• The application provides the user with a quiz to ensure the user
understood the law and its experiment.
• The application calculates scours for the user from the first experiment
then allows the user to move to a second experiment where the same
functions happen but with different laws and new experiments.
• The application must never allow the user to go to the next stage until the
previous stage of the experiment is finished.
